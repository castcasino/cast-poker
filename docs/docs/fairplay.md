# ðŸ˜‡ What is Fairplay?

Let's discover how we can be **100% CHEAT-PROOF** in less than 5 minutes.

## Introduction

Here is what you'll need to know in this lesson:
- hash
- pre-image
- hmac-512


## Shuffling

Before each round:
1. A "random" seed is chosen.
2. Cards are shuffled, based on the generated seed.
3. The seed is NOT revealed until AFTER the round has completed.

:::info YOU SHOULD KNOW

__A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is planned for deployment in the very near future.__

A TEE is built on a hardware-defined secure enclave, which can be either part of a CPU or a separate chip, strengthening application security by encrypting data in use and enforcing access controls on different memory regions.

You can also find out more by visiting __[Intelâ€™s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) site](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx)__.
