So, today I decided to further explore this pretty interesting concept of embeddable, interactive (but image-only) "frames" in social media feeds.

Not really a big social media fan .. but this seems VERY cool!

The only question is, "How permissionless will it be?" ðŸ¤”

## What is Farcaster?

[https://www.farcaster.xyz/](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)

Permissionlessly build and distribute social apps.

For any builders looking to get started, here are few recommended links:

- [Introduction to Frames](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/) - Understand what a frame is and how it works.
- [Build your first frame](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/getting-started) - Make mini-apps that run inside Farcaster.
- [Specification](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/spec) - A formal specification for the Frame standard.
