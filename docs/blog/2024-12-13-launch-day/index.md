# Launch Day

After about a month of casually #BUIDLing on top of the knowledge and experience of the world-class Farcaster team; the day has finally arrived to kick the tires on my 1st Frame/MiniApp.

Could there possibly be a better day to launch a NEW app, on a brand NEW platform, using an all NEW tech stack, than Friday the 13th?

__Surely not .. LET'S GO!__ ðŸ¥³

This is an __ALPHA__ launch for very early testers/players.

Mostly, this is me needing to actually __SEE__ how this all works on a __LIVE__ platform. Which is necessary, so I can effectively continue development on not only this app, but other games already in the works by [__Cast Casino DAO__](https://cast.casino).

# Provably Fair

Cast Poker is 100% provably fair. Each respective blockchain controls the outcome of the cards that are dealt to the community and the individual players.

# User Interface

The user interface (UI) is very simple.

Take a look at the [__Smart Contracts__](/contracts) for more info on how this game was built.
